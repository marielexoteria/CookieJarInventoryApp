App Name
Cookie Jar Inventory App 1.0

App description
Inventory app made for a fictional cookie shop. It is the final app made for the Android Basics Nanodegree, as part of the Google Developer Challenge by Google and Udacity.

The app creates a SQLite database and with the help of a contract, a cursor loader and a database helper, it enables users to perform CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) actions. App users can easily add cookies to the database, edit existing cookies, ordering from a supplier via a phone call or an e-mail, and delete cookies. Data validation is in place checking for empty fields as well as invalid e-mail.

Built With
Android Studio
XML
Java
UI design made with Sketch, following the Material Design guidelines
